## Project Requirements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure due to concerns about the privacy of user data and the potential increase in the cost of managed services for GenAI.

They want to invest in an AI PC with a budget of $10,000 to $15,000. They have 300 active students, all located within the city of Nagasaki.

## Presumptions

We assume that the open-source LLMs we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of $10,000 to $15,000.

We plan to connect a single server in our office to the internet, which should provide sufficient bandwidth to serve the 300 students.

## Information Management Strategy

There is a concern about copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Key Considerations

We are considering using IBM Granite because it is a truly open-source model with traceable training data, allowing us to avoid copyright issues and understand the model's workings.
