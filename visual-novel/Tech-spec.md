# Game Design 

## Overview

### Game Concept

A visual novel designed to teach Japanese, with minimal interactivity focused on key decision points. The game follows a branching narrative ('if-else' tree), where player choices influence the storyline, scenarios, and endings. This structure effectively delivers Japanese language content while keeping the player engaged with the narrative.

### Target Audience

- Beginners in Japanese language (JLPT5 level)

### Platform

Web application

## Story and Setting

### Synopsis

You are an adult attending a private language school in Japan for one month to immerse yourself in the language.

## Core Story Framework
- Linear scene progression
- Each scene features one character interacting with the player
- Key decision points that lead to distinct story branches
- All interactions flow naturally from one to the next

**Post Office (Interior)**  
A well-lit, organized Japanese post office with tidy service counters and staff dressed in blue uniforms. Shelves line the walls, stocked with forms and packaging materials. Large windows let in natural light, highlighting the polished floors. A digital display shows the current customer in line, and posters with Japanese text adorn the walls. A small section is set up with writing supplies for customers to fill out forms.

A cozy, modern cafe blending Japanese and Western design elements. Wooden tables and comfortable chairs are arranged to create inviting spaces for conversation.

The walls are adorned with local art, and a bookshelf in the corner holds language exchange materials.

**Private Language Learning School (Classroom Interior)**  
A bright, modern classroom in a converted traditional Japanese building. Sliding paper doors, wooden floors, and large windows overlooking a small courtyard garden set the scene. The desks are arranged in a U-shape around a digital whiteboard. Colorful Japanese language posters and hiragana/katakana charts decorate the walls. A teacherâ€™s desk at the front holds organized teaching materials and a small computer.

The apartment blends traditional Japanese elements with modern amenities, including a wall-mounted air conditioner and a compact refrigerator.
