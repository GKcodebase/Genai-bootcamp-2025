### Best Practices
1.Be Specific – Instead of "Tell me about Agile," say "Explain Agile with examples, pros, and cons."
2.Provide Context – Mention background or goal (e.g., "I'm applying for a TPM role. Can you tailor a resume?").
3.Define Format – Ask for lists, tables, step-by-step guides, or code.
4.Use Examples & Comparisons – e.g., "Compare SQL vs. NoSQL with use cases."
5.Specify Constraints – e.g., "Write a Python script using pandas to process CSV files."
6.Break Down Questions – Instead of broad queries, split them into focused ones.
7.Refine Iteratively – Ask for improvements ("Make it more concise.").
8.Use Personas – "Act as a Senior TPM explaining roadmap creation."
9.Request Actionable Outputs – e.g., "Give a 3-month Java learning plan with resources."
