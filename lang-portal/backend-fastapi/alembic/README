# Database Initialization Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to initialize the database for the project. The database is used to store words, groups, study activities, and other related data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- SQLite3
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Set Up the Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment for the project:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

```

### 2. Configure Alembic
Alembic is used for database migrations. Ensure that Alembic is configured correctly by editing the `alembic.ini` file:

```sh
# alembic.ini
sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///./words.db
```
### 3. Create Initial Migration
Generate the initial migration script to create the database schema:

```sh
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
```
### 4. Apply Migration
Apply the migration to create the database schema:

```sh
alembic upgrade head
```

### 5. Seed the Database
Run the seed script to populate the database with initial data:

```sh
python seed.py
```
### 6. Verify Database
Verify that the database has been initialized correctly by checking the contents of the `words.db` file using SQLite3:

```sh
sqlite3 words.db
.tables
```
