cd project-directory
npm install

# For Python projects
cd project-directory
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Go projects
cd project-directory
go mod download
```

2. **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values

3. **Database Setup**: Follow project-specific database setup instructions

### Project-Specific Setup

Each project has its own setup requirements. Please refer to the individual project README files for detailed setup instructions.

## üìù Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the existing code style in each project
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Language-Specific Standards

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use ES6+ features
- Follow ESLint configurations
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Use virtual environments

#### Go
- Follow Go formatting standards (`go fmt`)
- Use proper error handling
- Write clear variable names
- Include tests for new functions

### File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for directories: `my-project-name`
- Use camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript files: `myComponent.js`
- Use snake_case for Python files: `my_module.py`
- Use PascalCase for component files: `MyComponent.vue`

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use the conventional commits format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

#### Examples
```bash
feat(ar-app): add Malayalam object detection
fix(visual-novel): resolve audio loading issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(lang-portal): add vocabulary API tests
```

### Commit Best Practices

- Make atomic commits (one feature/fix per commit)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include issue numbers when applicable: `fixes #123`

## üîç Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a feature branch**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards
